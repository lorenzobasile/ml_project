\section{Problem statement}
Leaf identification is the process of matching an unknown observed leaf to its proper scientific name. The development of computer technologies has increased the interest inside this field on automatic recognition systems in order to have an inexpensive and fast tool able to classify leaves.  

In this project our aim is to implement several supervised machine learning techniques that could develop a leaf classifier and propose the most effective one according to some performance indexes. \\
The input of this problem is given by 14 morphological and textural features of a picture of the sample leaf and the output is a number associated to its relative species. The classifiers that we present have been trained on a data-set provided by \cite{silva} that comprises 40 different plant species that has already been pre-processed.


\section{Assessment and performance indexes}
In order to assess how well the classifier would work if applied to unseen data, we used a $5$-fold cross validation ensuring that each class is represented in each fold. We have trained different classification models that have been compared using as performances indexes the Accuracy and the FPR and FNR of each class.
